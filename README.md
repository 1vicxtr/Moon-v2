# Moon 

This repository was created for Moon, a React-inspired language. Moon doesn't require any libraries or servers; everything you need is in this repository.

## Description

Just as the moon has phases, front-end web development also evolves in different stages. That's why the name Moon fits perfectly. You don't need servers or external programs: everything you need is right here, in this folder.


## Installation

 git clone https://github.com/1vicxtr/Moon.git
